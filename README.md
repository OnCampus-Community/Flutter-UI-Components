## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s7xbv9bz/production/1562d4dae8dc03456edca898e89c0f39ae086a8f-1600x1000.png?w=1200&h=750&auto=format&fm=webp)

Flutter UI Components is a collection of different pre made Ui components such as Buttons, Navigation Bars, along with other elements used in building Apps in Flutter. Each component has its own set of styles and the Flutter team have updated them regularly so that you can build fast and efficiently.

Here's why:

* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating Ui Components from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:
